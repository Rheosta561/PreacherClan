    cd PreacherClan
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

   

    ```bash

3. **Configuration:**

You will need to set environment variables to securely store sensitive credentials such as API keys and authentication details.

- Copy the example environment file to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

- Open `.env` and update the following values with your own credentials:

    ```env
    # Google OAuth Credentials
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret

    # Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key

    # Cloudinary API Keys
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret

    # App Email and App Password (used for notifications or transactional emails)
    APP_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    APP_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password
    ```

- **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub! It contains sensitive data.
